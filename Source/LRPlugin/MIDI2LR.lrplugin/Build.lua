Build.lua

Takes Database.lua and produces text lists and other tools for documentation
and updating. Has to be run under Lightroom to be properly translated,
but is not used by users of the plugin.

The tables below list all commands currently available in MIDI2LR for all submenus. The title row in each table corresponds with the name of the menu in the app. Controls marked *button* are intended to be used with a button or key, and unmarked controls are for faders or encoders.

*Note*: â€» symbol indicates that the command is undocumented and may not always behave as expected. Use cautiously.
