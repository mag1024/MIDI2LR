Keep a copy of MenuTrans.xml here for the installer to use. It will be placed in the user settings MIDI2LR directory if there isn't a MenuTrans.xml file there already. This is in the event that the user tries running the app for the first time without first running Lightroom, as MenuTrans.xml is normally produced by the Lightroom plugin to customize the menus, and lack of a file will cause an error.
