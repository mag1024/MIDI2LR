To send crash reports to me from Windows, you need to enable User-Mode Dumps.

You can enable them by double-clicking on the EnableUserDumps.reg file in this directory and allowing that to change your registry. If you do that, the dumps will be in your AppData\Local\CrashDumps directory. AppData is a hidden directory in your user directory.

If you want to edit the registry yourself, follow the instructions at https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb787181(v=vs.85).aspx.

In either event, contact me at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/midi2lr, tell me what version of MIDI2LR you got the dump from, and post the file somewhere (like a file-sharing service) where I can download it.

Thank you for your help!
